**[Beijing, January 5, 2017] BaishanCloud (BSC)**, a leading provider of cloud data integration, today announced that its cloud services have received official certification from Trusted Cloud administered by the Chinese Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CACIT) under the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). 

BaishanCloud received certification in the category of “Cloud Delivery Services,” a major component of its cloud data integration services. The certification committee is composed a panel of industry experts that evaluated such major areas as data security, service quality, service level agreement, service scalability, and operation management capability.

The Trusted Cloud certification standards are widely accepted internationally.  Dating back to June 2016, International Telecommunication Union (ITU) officially released Cloud Computing Framework and High-Level Requirements (ITU-T Y.3501 ed2).  The requirements incorporated three proposals led by the CAICT on Trusted Cloud Definition, Requirement and Use Cases. 

“The certification comes as recognition of our business,” said Huo Tao, CEO of BaishanCloud.  “As our business grows, we will continue to demonstrate to the market that BSC’s cloud services are creditable and reliable,” he continued.
