---

**[Beijing, June 30, 2016] BaishanCloud**(BSC), a leading provider of cloud managed services in China, today launched a cloud warehouse network (CWN-X) product.   As the second product in BSC’s cloud product suite, CWN-X is a distributed object storage product, focusing on the storage of hot data and data transfer among clouds.

Through a data-storage mode based on the frequency of data access, hardware technology with high IO performance, and a high network bandwidth, CWN-X records remarkable improvements in read-write speed and capacity management, helping enterprises significantly raise their storage and usage efficiencies.  Huo Tao, co-founder and CEO of BaishanCloud, said, “Our cloud storage product is launched in response to current trends in tiered storage, whereby hot data is becoming hotter and cold data is becoming colder.  We hope that CWN-X will help bridge private and public clouds to allow data to flow more freely.”

CWN-X is characterized by the following four key features:

**Self-Structured Edge Storage**: Utilizing an optical data center interconnect (DCI) to ensure uploading and downloading from the closest IDC to significantly improve user experience;

**Peered Multi-Active Storage Nodes**: Using a decentralized backup configuration, it ensures large file synchronization and cross IDC failovers within seconds, thus increasing the availability of storage services;

**Auto Detection of Data Access Frequency**: Its layer-differentiated data storage ensures an asynchronous merger of fresh and historical data; and 

**Intelligent Quality Control**: A real-time self-checking mechanism guarantees high service availability.  It also includes an auto data recovery system.

As an object storage product, CWN-X is capable of scaling out and handling demands for storage of ultra-large-scale unstructured data. CWN-X can achieve service availability of 99.99 percent and durability of 13 9s.
