  			<p>##An Entrepreneur with a “Rational Impulse”</p>

<p><em>Source: China Science &amp; Technology Daily, March 31, 2016</em></p>

<p>At the age of 30, with excitement and anxiety about the unknown future, I quit my job as a college teacher and went into business.  Now, at the age of 40, I am embarking on a new journey: I left the listed company where I had worked for years and, together with partners, began a new venture.</p>

<p>One can describe this transition as a kind of impulse.  Nowadays, with the lowering threshold for entrepreneurship, many more people are engaging in start-ups. Surrounded by the entrepreneurial hustle and bustle of Zhongguancun Street and the crowds of visitors at the Garage Cafe, after graduation many young people, with hormones for passion, are joining China’s massive troops of entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>In my opinion, however, entrepreneurship is more like a “rational impulse,” and the rational is in fact more important than the impulse.</p>

<p>First, to start a business is not to start a revolution. “Micro-innovations” make better sense.</p>

<p>Quite a few enterprises are shouting slogans of “revolution” or “disruption,” but innovation does not occur overnight. During these years, batches of O2O projects have emerged as if they are going to overthrow the entire economic mode.  But many of them violate commercial logic; they are neither B2C nor B2B, but rather they are V2C projects where the money of investors (V) is wasted by the rapid building of a user base (C), and the projects come to an end after all the investments have been spent.</p>

<p>In contrast, a rational entrepreneur should start from something with which he/she is familiar, and begin with micro-innovations.  For example, in Japan and Germany there are numerous micro-innovative enterprises whose long-term successes originated from component optimization instead of the overturning of industries or the creation of  big “ecosystems.”  It is the continuous exploration of innovations, regardless of how small they may be, and the sustainability of research and development that become transformative over time.</p>

<p>Second, entrepreneurship is more about forming a “League of Legends” than about individualistic heroism.</p>

<p>In the IT industry, there is no lack of top talent; they possess outstanding specialties but they rarely succeed when they start a business on their own. Entrepreneurship should be collective, with partners sharing and cooperating with one another in the spirit of a League of Legends, where some players serve as Mages and some as Alistar.  For instance, in our company there are seven partners, covering products, R&amp;D, marketing, and human resources.  After one year of operations, this has proved to be both effective and efficient.  As the company continues to grow, we plan to bring more partners on board.</p>

<p>In addition, it should be pointed out that nowadays relations between team leaders and team members need to be reshaped; entrepreneurship is no longer about building one single giant ship but rather about building an entire fleet.</p>

<p>In the past, the management pattern was more like a giant ship, where the leader and the members corresponded to the captain and the sailors, respectively.  The sailors followed the orders of the captain in terms of both direction and speed.  Today, however, such giant ships are too unwieldy.  The personalities of the staff should be allowed to come into full play, and the leader and the staff should form a fleet, whereby the initiative of individuals is enhanced by both independence and unity, and the wisdom of the leadership is reflected in its navigation of the fleet.</p>
