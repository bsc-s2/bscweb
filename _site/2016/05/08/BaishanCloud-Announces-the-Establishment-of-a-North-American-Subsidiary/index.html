##BaishanCloud Announces the Establishment of a North American Subsidiary
**[Beijing, March 9, 2016], BaishanCloud** (BSC), a leading provider of cloud managed services in China, announced today that it has established a wholly-owned subsidiary in North America.  

Located in Seattle, the subsidiary will facilitate the cloud-delivery needs of Chinese customers in the U.S. market and help U.S. multinationals reach the China market.  “The opening of our U.S. subsidiary represents a first step in BaishanCloud’s global strategy.  We will continue to expand globally to better serve the needs of our customers,” said Huo Tao, co-founder and CEO of BSC.    

The subsidiary will be led by Eddie Zhao, partner and general manager of global business operations at BSC.  Eddie is a veteran IT professional who has over 10 years of experience in business operations, sales, and marketing.  He previously held key managerial positions at China Railcom, Digital China, and ChinaCache.  Most recently, Eddie worked as senior product manager at Cummins, Inc., where he assumed full responsibility for product global expansions. 

“The fact that we chose to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary instead of a branch office reflects our long-term commitment to global expansion.  With our plan to set up an R&D center in the United States, the subsidiary will become an important driving force behind BaishanCloud’s research and development,” said Eddie Zhao.

The growing demand among enterprise customers in China for cloud services is creating unprecedented market opportunities for companies such as BSC.  Leveraging its nationwide and global network coverage, BSC is capable of providing customers innovative cloud-delivery services with a much-improved quality of services.
